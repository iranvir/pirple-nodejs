# What is NodeJS, exactly?
Node.js is a server-side JavaScript runtime environment. V8 is the car's engine
and drivetrain. Node.js is everything else that makes the car. You are the
driver.

Node.js is a C++ application that embeds the V8 js engine.

Node.js now presents itself as two applications:
1. A Script Processor
2. A REPL (Read Eval Print Loop)
